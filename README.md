# Position Projection
An After Effects tool that allows you to quickly extract 3d coordinates and place any object to it  
Requirement: Position pass and Camera (or Depth pass and Camera)

## Installation
1. Download the tool: https://github.com/eirisocherry/pos-projection/releases  
2. Move the `Pos Projection` folder and `Pos_Projection.jsx` script to:  
`C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects <version>\Support Files\Scripts\ScriptUI Panels`  
3. Restart After Effects.  



## Usage

COD4: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKsAgvfdi4I&list=PLiyMyFJsq2_VeOvBGMmrXcSAouRKO_hUB  
5. Import a depth map  
6. Select the depth map and setup a projection by pressing **[+]** button  
7. Adjust **'Depth settings':**  

**'Black is Near'** check it if a black color is near on your depth map, uncheck if it's not.  

**'Far'** the farthest depth point value:  
a) If the depth is normalized to [0..1] rgb range, then set far to:
CSGO (if you use my cfgs): regular `4096`, exr: `25000`  
CS2 (if you use my cfgs): regular `4096`, exr: `25000`  
COD4: `4080`  

b) If your depth is not normalized (rgb values are higher than), then set `Far` to `1`  
8.  Project any objects you want.  

- The script is heavy and may crash your After Effects, but don't worry!  
It automatically saves your project before doing any actions, so even if your AE will crash, you will not lose any of your progress  
- 'Auto Orient' works only with EXR depth maps
